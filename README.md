# Training-logistic-regression-algorithm-from-scratch


## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression for classification tasks using a Jupyter Notebook. Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary and multi-class classification problems.

## Features

Implements Logistic Regression for classification

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Model training and evaluation

Visualization of results

## Dataset

The Dataset is taken from kaggle which is titanic_dataset.The dataset used in this project consists of numerical features and corresponding class labels. Preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values

Normalizing data

Splitting into training and testing sets

## Data Preprocessing

Missing values were checked and handled appropriately.

Features were scaled to ensure uniformity in data.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

## Model 

The Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn was implemented.

A custom Logistic Regression model was also implemented from scratch.

Both models were trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.

## Model Training

The models are trained using the logistic regression algorithm.

Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using:

Accuracy score


## Results

The results of the model evaluation include:

Accuracy of custom Logistic Regression implementation: 0.7832

Accuracy of scikit-learn Logistic Regression implementation: 0.7972
